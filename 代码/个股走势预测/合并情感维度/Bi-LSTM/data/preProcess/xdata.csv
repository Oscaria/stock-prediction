review
with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkayvisually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himthe actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs musiclots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter
the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to hg wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings
the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park  a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna like ¨jurassik park¨ and some scientists resurrect one of natures most fearsome predators the sabretooth tiger or smilodon  scientific ambition turns deadly however and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors  tourists and scientificmeanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger  in addition  a security agent stacy haiduk and her mate brian wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons the sabretooths themselves  of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one natures most fearsome predators furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victimsthe movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hair-raising chillsfull of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effectsthe story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming foodactors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts runningbound and leaps or dangling over walls  and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realisticgory and violent attack scenes  other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following : ¨sabretooth2002¨by james r hickox with vanessa angel david keith and john rhys davies and the much better ¨10000 bc2006¨ by roland emmerich with with steven strait cliff curtis and camilla belle this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films miller is an australian director usually working for television tidal wave journey to the center of the earth and many others and occasionally for cinema  the man from snowy river zeus and roxannerobinson crusoe  rating : below average bottom of barrel
it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didnt i read somewhere either dont care for opera dont care for wagner or dont care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagners swan-song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textits questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagners text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music -- in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i cant think why syberberg couldnt splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of musicthe sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film
superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80s exploitation hooray! the pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that were dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later were up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist-fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sisters naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesnt mind at all sick dude! anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever! the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly _ and i wont reveal for what reason _ bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bos principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film theres the obligatory were-falling-in-love montage and loads of other attractions! my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: none!
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool 45
this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so-so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasnt so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie
i watched this video at a friends house im glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups most not related to manned flight sibrels smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
a friend of mine bought this film for £1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girlsadam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ships resident comedian - the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea sandlers character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead hes rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sickperhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time
this movie is full of references like mad max ii the wild one and many others the ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference or tribute to peter lorre this movie is a masterpiece we´ll talk much more about in the future
what happens when an army of wetbacks towelheads and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their butts of course another laughable example of reagan-era cultural fallout bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala
although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception i didnt actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparisonthe story and the way it is written is no question: it is capote there is no need for more wordsthe play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother this time this certainty is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr edwards is clearly the top of all their professioni recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves
mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spallwhile we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spalls range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertorywhile an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brooks script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into actswere introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldnt tell if this is a private or public school as they gather _ the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls _ but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisors role than the martinets she usually has to playa break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but its much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the us over christmasnathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harveys redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercialswhile it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than ive seen in most holiday-themed tv movies
i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldnt be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish its nothing more than a b or c-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designerlike the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plots actually ok for a sg flickill never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgivenesstoo bad - i miss kelly lebrock--jimbo
note to george litman and others: the mystery science theater 3000 riff is i dont think so *breeder*my favorite riff is why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not! over all i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie you really cant make much fun of the dialog; bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do betteri would recommend that you buy a book and read hamlet
stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family newcomers to rural maine find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father dale midkiff then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite rightbelow average horror picture starts out clumsy insulting and inept and continues that way for a while with the absolute worst element being midkiffs worthless performance it gets a little better toward the end with genuinely disturbing finale in point of fact the whole movie is really disturbing which is why i cant completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable decent supporting performances by fred gwynne as the wise old aged neighbor and brad greenquist as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem filmking has his usual cameo as the ministerfollowed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert is it any wonder that shes had no mainstream film work since410
`the matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `twilight zone-ish manner the general rule applies here- and this sequel doesnt match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesnt even compare with it`reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nose-dives after a disastrous first 45 minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong `zion rave scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but its also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance musicthe bullet-time aspect of `the matrix was a good addition but in `reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that `the matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `star wars saga havethe acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo weavings `agent smith- the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress a poor thrown-together movie `the matrix reloaded is a disappointment those who didnt like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this ones for die-hard fans only even in the movies own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating: 4510
ulli lommels 1980 film the boogey man is no classic but its an above average low budget chiller thats worth a look the sequel 1983s boogey man ii is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least its an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldnt have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled return of the boogey man when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for iti should have known better though the opening title is boogey man 3 this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anywaypros: ha! thats a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung lets seeit has footage from the boogey man and umits mercifully short yeah thats about itcons: where to start decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are botched suzanna loves character was named lacey not natalie! and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978 also if this has a 3 in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genrefinal thoughts: the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves its one thing if that had been an original film that was the directors first and sucked but instead its supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror filmmy rating: 15
this movie is one among the very few indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the pt styled film songsthe cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entiretygone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when meena kumari refuses to say yes as an approval for nikah marriage bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy at the moment raj kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumarkamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinemas history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meenas close ups because meena kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971
most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this levelcheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman where johnson felt trapped by his blessings fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandleri see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that youre not alonejerry
soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70s and still very persuasive even by todays standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking this films quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive with over-population unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylents most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesnt really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70s cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and theres a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet
michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scopethe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackthose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen710
this happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler based rather loosely on rudyard kiplings memorable poem as well as his novel soldiers three qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the 1880s cary grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together set in faraway india this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din sam jaffe who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee sergeant archibald cutter cary grant of the last outpost sergeant macchesney oscar-winner victor mclaglen of the informer and sergeant ballantine douglas fairbanks jr of the dawn patrol are a competitive trio of hard-drinking hard-brawling and fun-loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins joan fontaine and enter the tea business naturally cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentines plans when their superiors order them back into action with sgt bertie higginbotham robert coote of the sheik steps out cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees lenser joseph h august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography
i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from steves animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script dont go if you must see it wait for the video
the script for this movie was probably found in a hair-ball recently coughed up by a really old dog mostly an amateur film with lame fx for you zeta-jones fanatics: she has the credibility of one mr binks
looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this 1985 version that looked interesting wow! it was amazing! very much a ken russell kind of film -quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire -it wasnt much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance; one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs: no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right
note to all mad scientists everywhere: if youre going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i dont care if hes a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha! get a load of this!!! paul the monster is ripping me to shreds!!!!! thats the worst part about this movie is this shark-thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there arent other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead: shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but thats a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie
what the  is this  this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you cant set your expectations for an 80s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for 089$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldnt possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didnt care they didnt try to create a tiny bit of tension the director  stephen carpenter -- i guess its much easier to find money with a name like that  also made the kindred 1986 wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga !!!  who   yeah thats right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits shes the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares  the rest of the actorsthey dont deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting youre hoping they die a quick and painful deathand not only their charactersmy humble opinion = 0  10
intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip-off i do not make this observation lightly _ i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1600 films 93% on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise - aimee & jaguar its in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty! to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right _ we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow-up or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist  right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that its difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of sugarplams is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to queer culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at $995 this film would have been way overpriced; i understand that its soon to be re-priced under $20 which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of $2995 and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews _ i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director  writer  actor in such a way that its obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it
would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didnt contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isnt any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they dont appear to live anywhere or have parents because p*rn films dont need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i havent ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old celebrated english film although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins richard burton sleepwalks through his role and sophia lorens closed in this movie face doesnt display much passion either **
simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst looking rather grown up danny huston and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups i liked the film its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies7 out of 10
faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer or something relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a petit-bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski no disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the films great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why arent other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film
eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes eva returning to her fathers home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched extase for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version my vote is eighttitle brazil: êxtase ecstasy
even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics its still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good jokefirst off jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor mans gerard depardieunaturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that the poor mans box office poisonreally that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisiewhat am i saying it isnt lets just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasnt sharp enough satire is a tricky thingif it isnt sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke insteadi think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way eitherfor a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel filmvery sharp satire[potential spoiler alert]really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbés character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of controlthough im guessing he didnt cast jeroen krabbé because hes the worst actor and every character hes played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except hes incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well i just dont see it so you understand the dilemma im faced with here right it is the worst film ever because hes supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th mans deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhovens reputation as a good director etc etc
if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captainafter ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire lifeacting---there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law againpaltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decisionstory---soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progressesdirecting---none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deali would have to give this movie a 0 out of 10 avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release
although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older womanim so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the charactersthe story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the storyi highly recommend this movie and i must confess ill forever look at my mom in a different light!
dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thorntons character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey - merk
i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branaghs performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carters star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep
ill dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery _ its painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what theyre doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish theyd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to sufferthe films premise _ if indeed it has one _ is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal! thats not a story_ its a passing thought at best - one that shouldve passed any self-respecting filmmaker by the leading actor _ if you can call him that _ is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck whats that you say__ he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isnt that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actors on-screen presence! my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by `explaining the action first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition_ show dont tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank!the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex-secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the filmthe films title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry dont be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office___ theres a very good reason for that!
at first sight this movie doesnt look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 65 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surpriseyou would at first expect that this is a normal average typical 30s movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watchthe story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love-story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertainingthe movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesnt waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or funa delightful pleasant simple romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more!810
well then what is it! i found nicholsons character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica hustons character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut its not that i dont get it its not that i dont think that some of the ideas couldve lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that were supposed to accept these ideas and thats what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as afunny or beven remotely interesting!!! this was a waste of my time so dont let the hype get the best of youit is a waste of your time! with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful

i dont know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobici can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they dont get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway its not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do its full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funnyi hated it and im not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb werent as unbiased in their judgment
i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved; the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in 2007 when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didnt mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane
i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the uncovering of the murdererthe interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt columbo making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detectives real life fame as a crime-solver this is one of the best of many great columbo installments
this film is a massive yawn proving that americans havent got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them! the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 810 it isnt just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce
i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer - sue smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didnt need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and in doing so embrace lifes possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped somersault i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good! i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods im glad i saw it
when i saw the previews for this movie i didnt expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and thats being generousfirst of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to endsecondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming pancakes!!! at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves ive never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come fromi just simply couldnt believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains outplease save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative
okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole 80s genre of these kind of movies because you dont see many like this one anymore! i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating ive never seen another movie like this one well not horror anywaybasically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranksso its like 10 years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters butthey are the only ones receiving them! so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off byyeah you probably know what happens!the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out betteri think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical!~*~cupidgrl~*~
stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in wild reeds and he is one of frances biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu newcomer jamie elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister with whom he has a competitive relationship soon the two are falling in lovethe films fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs bits and pieces of the present and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting director sebastien lifshitz doesnt signal which time-period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out: the films final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart-breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must-see cinema
though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin sxsw film just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love and elizabeth this movie deserves an audience an inside look at the staging of the scottish play as actors call macbeth when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe with a wonderfully evocative score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not world-class but totally satisfying
yikes this is pretty bad the play isnt great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as peploe doesnt decide how she wants to treat the materials theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that youre watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvinos central performance is breath-takingly poor: stage-y and plummy its as if shes playing the part via helena bonham-carters merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but its hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaws ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana riggs daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertoluccis magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence
last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show youre not watchingwell theyre right that youre not watching it it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147translation: this is the lowest-rated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore its as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceledthe only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest-rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure
what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick: do not waste your time on this film
elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clintons bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now! is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequencethen you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven 90s hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadianfrench production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films co-producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
what a stunning episode for this fine series this is television excellence at its best the story takes place in 1968 and its beautifully filmed in black & white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images this is a story about two men who fall in love but i dont want to spoil this it is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in america written by the superb tom pettit and directed by the great jeannot szwarc we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob dylans gorgeous ah but i was so much older then im younger than that now as sung by the byrds this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars beautiful
this movie was ok but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there arent enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable & that is the reason why i rated it so low its watchable but dont expect anything great
as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 ive purchased thats been made recently i wasnt sure what to expecta cambodian hit-man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit-man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit-man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie its like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking theres no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended
yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! thats because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isnt at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good its one of the better movies of this style i have seenthe unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenantsthe first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writers block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliotts block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alivethe second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdownchristopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very wellthe fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film its actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwees line when he basically said that lees and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosis! perhaps this is why lee didnt take this part! despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segmentconsidering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing its hard not to like this film
a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it upill admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experiencethe characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplaynot that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly motherking manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little differentokay - a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan
i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if youre expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash! the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle-aged man! the child is also lusted after by other leering men its sickeningpeter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple its revoltingi dont see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles
i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features skippy from family ties gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on vinyl! yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie skippy is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies
it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there &  the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous! hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded! i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop!
a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus andthats about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made its debut in e-mail inboxes across the world
warning: possible spoilers but not really - keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i wont have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no-one else did them; and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 & 2 plus teri hatcher from tvs supermanevery scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the shows perennial award-winning lead nicknamed americas sweetheart the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celestes show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because its always such a genuine thrill: adam did you watch i won!

i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didnt pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wangs family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying arttogether wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which cant help but to move and inspire
i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i dont want to spoil this film - dont worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but heres an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horseto be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid
i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isnt ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesnt make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit
how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the `worst film of all time by the `worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because its `so bad its goodan analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band-wagon syndrome--lets bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws wed citethe films universal poor quality goes without saying-- sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesnt allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this films poorness that thats a task not worth pursuingmy impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny   and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobsons sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grinchuckle moments all im sure none intentionalspiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad its good no it had just enough i cant believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing moredefinitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that wouldve significantly improved the experience for me so bad its mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey

as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates barely even reaching feature length can i do ittill i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you cant believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example: the santa claus gag; others are so long that you cant believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example: the students awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry dont get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny the iron  phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4
i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like: you son-of-a-gun! you son-of-a-witch! shoot! and well forget you!ok byeps: does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than its seen since the days of granny and jed clampett plot centers on two chauffers whove bet on which one of them can bed his employer both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy -- bisset and woronov first if manuel wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend! lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy teenaged niece on a year long missionary trip to africahilarious fun
some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a students graduate thesis in film schoolthere are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for hisher chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like youre at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw upall right im being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said the camera work is quite goodbut i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the films making seems to know that this is the kind of film theyre supposed to be makingthat betrayal is what hurts; but even without it the fact remains that we dont like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just dont carei took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldnt give me my money backnow that really hurts
the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march a very good film indeed hollywoods love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carreras sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesnt make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesnt do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concernedalthough its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies
jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy star in this modern musical that showcases macdonalds comic abilities surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue eye-popping costumes and sets yes b&w add to the surreal dreamlike quality of the entire film several good songs enliven the film with the twinkle in your eye number a total highlight including a fun jitterbug number between macdonald and binnie barnes also in the huge cast are edward everett horton reginal owen mona maris douglas dumbrille and anne jeffreys also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther dale almira sessions grace hayle gertrude hoffman rafaela ottiano odette myrtile cecil cunningham and many othersgreat fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her jitterbugvamp routines she could do it all

those who are not familiar with cassandra petersons alter-ego elvira then this is a good place to startelvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of moneyunfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlockthe film is actually pretty funny with peterson aka elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and dont forget tomorrow were showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course
a sequel to actually a remake of disneys 1996 live-action remake of 101 dalmations cruella devil glenn close is released from prison after being cured of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr pavlov ugh! but the cure is broken when cruella hears the toll of big ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hidesthis movie is bad on so many levels starting with the fact that its a thanksgiving family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine glenn close over-over-over-over-acts as cruella with all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end -- i hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheckspeaking of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film of course the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs they serve as the macaulay culkins of this movie pulling all the stupid home alone gags on the villains biting them in the crotch running over their hands with luggage carts squirting them with icing etc etc etc ad nauseum i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humansgerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out french furrier the two human dog lovers -- rehashed from the earlier film but with different actors -- are completely boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home watching the dinner scene from lady and the tramp i thought to myself oh please dont go there! i half-expected the humans to do a satire on the lady and the tramp dinner scene -- as charlie sheen did in hot shots: part deux -- doing the spaghetti strand kiss pushing the meatball with his nose etcand dont get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idles voicethe costumes were nominated for an oscar and the costumes in the movie *are* good but they are the only good thing in the movie the rest of it is unbearable dreck
there are movies like plan 9 that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like waterworld that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love cowgirls have none of these redemptions the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what ive been told the book is enjoyablehow then could this movie be so intolerably bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law because the meat packing plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experiencethis movie now defines the basement for me it is so bad it isnt even good for being bad
and im serious! truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching whats so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is:1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesnt matter if its real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis sachar! the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldnt put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script! the one-liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack theres not a song in this film that i havent fallen for and thats something considering im supposed to be a punk-rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if youre going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the booki do not work for the people who made holes by the way im just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you havent seen it do it now this very instant go!
channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because its so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious; completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth badtheres low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel im sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10x10 boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didnt learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scenewow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! i dont buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells likeand it looks likewell you know the restavoid like the plagueedit: apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence ie its refreshing to seesure it may be refreshing to see but that doesnt equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly id rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again
when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant! however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film-making this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film historythe opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainmentsarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any directors dream at its very corehowever sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtakingthe dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!! where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert townein a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feattherefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easyall in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is morethe romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art
it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b-movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters its very un-funny even for a turkey
i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film! ive not laughed so much when watching a film for ages! and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! this film may not appeal to some people i cant really say why without spoiling it! but each to their own! i loved it and highly recommend it!the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it!although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch
this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but i really cant recall when ive seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the conflict card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in*possible spoiler*the 40-or-so minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict
beautiful attracts excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on halmark producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish
complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too didnt most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries promptly impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free! first - this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d! what!!!! its not that hard to film in a car!!! second - the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with itthird - why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! watch it for a good laugh  but dont waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesnt fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! its a neurological drama ! it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a persons brainits the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deafno small feat for such a sort of a moviethe only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage !!!!!!
unfortunately for myself - i stumbled onto this show late in its lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline - but most of all the great actors! i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget moynahan was & the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez from carlitos way: rise to power and erika christensen swimfan i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime im viewing it on abcs website from the beginning
i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv its very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober depressing and not a little paranoid! despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! while not uninteresting in itself the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both dr strangelove [1964] and fail-safe [1964] and mercifully short the films single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents!
this was a hit in the south by southwest sxsw film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by ers gloria reuben and a scenery-chewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word macbeth is thought to bring on the plays ancient curse the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a well-known pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the green-eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes directors commentary and some deleted scenes as well
i gave 1 to this film i cant understand how ettore scolaone of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous! all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantialboring and not interesting too longtoo boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film
as a big fan of david mamets films and plays especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna i was expecting great things from this film instead i found myself annoyed by the films superficiality and lack of credibility racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized identity is totally reevaluated and men become heroes for no apparent reason because of his oaths taken as a cop the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal but then still refuses the minor action in addition a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting and the cops reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits needless to say after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet i was extremely disappointed to say the least 3 out of 10
i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb!!! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much
